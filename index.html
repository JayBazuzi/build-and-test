    <H1>The Problem</H2>

        <OL>
            <LI>
                <P>0h0m - Get idea about an open source project</P>
            </LI>
            <LI>
                <P>0h1m - git clone</P>
            </LI>
            <LI>
                <P>0h2m - try to compile</P>
            </LI>
            <LI>
                <P>1h0m - still can't compile. Give up.</P>
            </LI>

        <H1>Vision</H1>

        <B>Every source code repository should have a script in the root directory that does a build and run tests.</B>

        <H1>Details</H2>

            <UL>
                <LI>
                    <P>It should not assume prerequisites and machine configuration.</P>
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    <P>It should work out of the box on a clean machine. Ideally, you can take a clean machine and run `git
                        clone` followed by `build-and-test` and it will work.</P>
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    <P>Speed / incrementalism is not a goal. Developers that are in tune with the project will learn which steps
                        are optional in which contexts, and how to optimize their work cycle, but newbies don't need that
                        knowledge to use the script successfully.</P>
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    <P>It should be succinct and readable by a human. It's fine to call out to another tool to do the heavy
                        lifting.</P>
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    <P>Since it's succinct, if you need to write it in two languages (e.g. .CMD and .SH), that won't be too
                        painful.</P>
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    <P>It should mimic the CI configuration, which should also be succinct.</P>
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    <P>It should not have options to do other useful stuff beyond what CI validates.</P>
