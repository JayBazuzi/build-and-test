    <h1>Vision</h1>

    <p>The first time I clone a repository, it should be trivially obvious how to build it and run tests.</p>

    <p>Today, if I try to clone and build a repo and it doesn't work, and the how-to-build instructions are confusing /
        incorrect / incomplete, I'm likely to give up on the repo.</p>



    <h1>Values</h1>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>These</th>
                <th>Over These</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>Reliable</p>
                    <p>Readable and succinct</p>
                    <p>Works on a clean machine - do not assume prerequisites</p>
                    <p>Mimics CI build definition</p>

                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Fast</p>
                    <p>Incremental - only rebuild what is needed</p>
                    <p>Flexible - "build but don't run tests" or "build for 32-bit"</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>

    <h1>Measures</h1>

    <p>A newbie can clone your repo, run build-and-test, and see a successful result.</p>

    <h1>Obstacles</h1>

    <p>What if you implement this on Mac and I work on Mac? How do we make it work well for both?</p>

    <p>What if you implement this on Mac OSX 10.14 and a year later someone wants to run on Mac OSX 10.15? How do we
        make it work well as the OS changes?</p>

    <p>Is it really OK to install, say, a specific version of Visual Studio in this script? I think no. What are the
        right boundaries for what this script should and shouldn't do?</p>

    <h1>Methods</h1>

    <p>Place a script in the root of the repo named "build-and-test".</p>

    <p>Write it in a language that your target audience will already have. PowerShell, CMD, Bash, and Python are good
        candidates. Since it's simple, it's OK to write it in two languages (e.g. PowerShell and Bash).</p>

    <p>Call out to other tools to do the heavy lifting. This script doesn't implement your build, it <i>invokes</i> your
        build. I human can then read this script to learn how to invoke your build, and then manually mimic it with
        variation for other needs.</p>

    <h1>Collaborators</h1>

    <p>Consider a script that will configure a clean machine to be a usable development environment for this project.
